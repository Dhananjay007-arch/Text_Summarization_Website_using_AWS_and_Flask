# Text_Summarization_Website_using_AWS_and_Flask
Text Summarization is an effective technique to extract important phrases and sentences from a long and monotonous document. It has applications in education, research, news articles, etc. But even if a fully functional text summarizer is developed, it cannot be of much use if it works only on our local machine. The code must be deployed on the internet so the people who need it can be benefitted. Keeping this is mind, we have deployed a text summarizer on AWS and created a website wherein the users will enter a short text and the summary will be displayed in few sentences.
